# Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by this Code of Conduct. By contributing, you agree to uphold these guidelines to help foster a welcoming and productive community.

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Being respectful, inclusive, and considerate
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being mindful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples include using an official project account, posting via an official social media channel, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns:

Preferably, send a private report to the maintainer: [Your Name]
- **GitHub**: [Your GitHub Profile URL]
- **Email**: [Your Email Address]
- **LinkedIn**: [Your LinkedIn Profile URL]
- **Twitter/X**: [Your Twitter/X Profile URL]

If you are comfortable, you may also open an issue on the repository with the "coc-report" label. Avoid including sensitive details publicly; maintainers can follow up privately. All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The maintainers will respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement

Maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct.

1. **Correction**
   - **Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.
   - **Consequence**: A private, written warning from project maintainers providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

   - **Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.
   - **Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in project spaces as well as external channels like social media.

   - **Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.
   - **Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time.
